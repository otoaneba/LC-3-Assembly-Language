# LC-3-Assembly-Language

This repository shows my understanding of how a code and the hardware interacts between one another by showcasing two assembly language code for the LC-3, the Little Computer 3. It also shows how one uses the stack memory to initialize a specific function. The two assembly code I wrote are the Greatest Common Divisor, and the binary search functions. Both done recursively. 

## Greatest Common Divisor 
Greatest common divisor is the largest positive integer that divides two integers.

## Binary Search
Binary search algorithm works for a binary search tree.
